P2P audio sharing over the internet



#### What is this?

Foodub lets you share your audio with other people. Not music, or files, but audioâ€”what comes out of the speakers or headphone jack.

It also tries to pull metadata about what's playing, and there's an option to switch who's audio is playing after every track. This way everyone gets a turn to DJ, straight from their devices.

The audio is streamed peer to peer, and you never have to upload any files. Whatever you hear, so does everyone else.

Also, it's really easy to use. If the world were a better place, you could do everything in browser. For now, you can share audio from individual tabs in Chrome just by installing a Chrome extension. Unfortunately if you want to share what you hear on the rest of your computer, you'll need to install some stuff. Hopefully one day it won't be like this anymore.

What about phones? We'll see.

#### Why would I want this?

Let's say some friends comes over to work at your place. You're playing some music from your laptop, but someone else wants to use your speakers, because they found this really weird dubstep trap song on YouTube. They'd either have to use your computer or connect their phone/computer to the speakers. That's stupid when we have a whole internet, and methods to send data wirelessly.

Another time to use this is to take turns playing music at a party or something. Or maybe you want to put on a concert, but over the internet, and stream everything you're mixing in Ableton. Who knows.

Note: If you're putting on a public performance of someone else's work, chances are you owe them royalties and you need licenses. Foodub doesn't deal with this for you, because it can't, so it's your call.

#### Why is this over the internet and not just a local network thing?

Because by making it work over the internet, you can use browsers instead of installing stuff.

#### Can't I already do this by using VNC and blah blah blah?

Yes but just because you can doesn't mean it's good or that you'd want to.

#### Why did you make this?

Because I wanted to be able to play audio with my co-workers without having cables running everywhere, and because other solutions had a user experience that I didn't like.
